# CameraIntegrationGrafana
Integration of videocamera panels in Grafana using a central VPN server and without the need of any type of proxy


The objective is to be able to visualize video cameras inside any Grafana panels. 
This was also done in a cloud server that serves as a OpenVPN server aswell whose clients are the routers to which the cameras are connected.

The real tests were done with:
- go2rtc v
- Reolink Cameras
- Grafana v
- 
- nssm v
